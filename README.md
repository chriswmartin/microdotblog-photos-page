## Customize

This plugin supports two types of layouts. The currently used layout can be set, by you, in the Micro.blog plugin settings. The layout options are "grid" and "masonry".

### Grid:

The "grid" style uses a fixed height images in a row. The images will be slightly cropped in order to flex out on the row.

### Masonry:

The "masonry" layout instead maintains the aspect ratio of each photo so that the rows are pleasantly uneven.
